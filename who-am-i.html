                    Emir Bublis was born in Izmir in 1989. His passion for cinema began at the age of seven and eventually grew into a career built on storytelling. He started out writing for TV projects and working as a script doctor. His professional journey took its first official step in 2015, when he joined the script evaluation committee of the TRT TV Films Competition as a jury member.

                    Between 2015 and 2017, he wrote, directed, and produced his first major project, the 24-episode animated series Erdem for TRT Çocuk. In 2018, he wrote and directed the 30-episode short animated series Ramadan Diaries. That same year, he also worked as a script consultant on the animated series Dumper and Skoop, which aired on the MinikaGO channel and on China's iQiyi streaming platform.

Spiralis reached the semi-finals at the Boden International Film Festival in Sweden and was subsequently released in the United States on Amazon Prime, Tubi TV, and Cineverse.
