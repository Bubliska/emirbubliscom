# assets/

Place your personal profile image in this folder and name it `your-photo.jpg`.

Options:
- To use a local file: save the image as `assets/your-photo.jpg`.
- To use a different filename: update the `background-image` URL in `who-am-i.html`.
- To use a remote URL instead: replace the `background-image` line in `who-am-i.html` with the URL, for example:
  `style="background-image: url('https://example.com/your-photo.jpg');"`

Preferred size/aspect:
- Aspect ratio: 3:4 (portrait) works best for the layout.
- Recommended resolution: 800×1067 or similar.

After adding/replacing the file, restart the dev server or refresh the page.
